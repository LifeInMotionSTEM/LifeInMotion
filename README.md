# Life in Motion

This project is part of the 2025 State Farm STEM Challenge.

## Goal
Inspired by [State Farm Drive Safe & SaveÂ®](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/drive-safe-save), Life in Motion is an application designed with the goal of improving the consumer's physical health and reduce liability for life insurance providers. 

## Flow
1. Collect physical activity data of the user.
    - Could be integrated with [Apple Health](https://www.apple.com/health/) through the use of [HealthKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit).
2. Calculate "Smart Score" from health data.
    - For example: The amount of time the user spends standing and the amount of steps they take.
3. Apply discount (if applicable) to the user's life insurance rates.
